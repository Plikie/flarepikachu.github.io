                <h1>Currency</h1>
                <p>In Warlords 2 PvE, there are three primary currencies involved in purchasing items, weapons and upgrades. Additional currencies may be introduced on a temporary or permanent basis depending on their purpose and objective of those currencies.</p> 

                <p>There was some consideration to add mob drops as part of costs for various purchases, but we ultimately decided not to do so. While it would make for greater immersion if mob were given drops that were mob related and the unlocked upgrades would have some relation to those mobsâ€™ abilities, adding mob drops was simply unnecessary for our first iteration of PvE. Adding mob drops means saving an extra hundreds of lines of information per player and requires substantial effort to conceptualize (name, iconize) mob drops while designing appropriate upgrades based on mob drops.</p>

                <p>While we will likely not add mob drops for every single mob we add, certain bosses may have unique drops in the future and their drops can be traded in for unique rewards.</p>
