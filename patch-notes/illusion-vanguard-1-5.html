                        <li>There is now a cap to how many weapons you can have.</li>

                        <li>Players that have more weapons than the page limit allows will not have their weapons deleted, but any subsequent weapon will be auto-salvaged until they go under the weapon page limit.</li>

                    <p>Weapon title upgrades are distinct to each title and weapon. Upgrading one title on your weapon does not unlock the upgraded effect for other titles and weapons you own.</p>
                    <p>You can upgrade your weapon title effects through the weapons menu by opening the config menu for your weapon and right click the name tag (where you used to select your titles).</p>
