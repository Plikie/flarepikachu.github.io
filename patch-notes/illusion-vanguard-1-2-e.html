                    <p>
                        This title update revolves around three things: The introduction of activated abilities, nerfing
                        all energy-related stats on weapon titles, and buffing the impact of damage % on weapons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Activated abilities allows players to better control when they want their weapon ability to
                        activate. This should be a welcome change, other than the fact that you'd have to get used to
                        pressing your 9 slot/key to activate this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The decision to nerf energy gain from Legendary Weapons was twofold: Firstly, high base values
                        of energy gain can be easily boosted by Weapon Upgrades and Star Pieces towards huge values.
                        Secondly, having such high energy generation for weapon titles could lead to balancing issues
                        with future content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As such, we have decided to drastically reduce the base values of Energy per Second/Energy per
                        Hit that weapons provide, with the highest amount being 4 to stop the base value from being
                        scaled too high.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For <a class="a-no-format red bold" href="/titles/vigorous.html">Vigorous</a> and <a class="a-no-format red bold" href="/titles/suspicious.html">Suspicious</a>, we elected to move most of their energy regeneration to their
                        ability, meaning that the bulk of these titles' energy generation is not boosted by Weapon
                        Upgrades nor Star Pieces. Suspicious received a blanket nerf but should still function similarly
                        as before, albeit with much more RNG and cost to set up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While overall legendary energy gain was reduced, we drastically buffed titles that offered damage bonuses. We previously overestimated the impact of a 15% damage boost, which when put into perspective of a system where skill tree upgrades give upwards of 80% Damage/Healing bonuses, that 15% damage boost didn't matter all that much. Allowing <a class="a-no-format red bold" href="/titles/divine.html">Divine</a> and <a class="a-no-format bold red" href="/titles/fervent.html">Fervent</a> to stack up to 60% Damage Bonus means that skilled players can benefit from maintaining the damage boost's uptime as long as they play in a deliberate way. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="a-no-format red bold" href="/titles/requiem.html">Requiem</a> was intended to be great but not exclusive for Revenant and now is equipped to directly benefit the Revenant class greatly. You can easily maintain your 5 stacks of Requiem by constantly activating Undying Army, but at the cost of... playing Revenant? :). Whether or not to utilize this weapon title is your decision to make!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="a-no-format red bold" href="/titles/stalwart.html">Stalwart</a> now has an additional ability that prevents you from being oneshot from one damage instance as long as your HP is above 80%. This covers a previous weakness of the title being unable to cover for when your HP is above 80% and you take a ton of damage. There isn't much use-case other than Narmer currently, but this can change very soon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="a-no-format red bold" href="/titles/enhanced.html">Enhanced</a> now has an additional ability that boost the duration of the active abilities of allies, such as Inferno, Berserk, etc. This duration increase is triggered for each ally "hit" by the caster's blue rune (slot 4). <br><br>
                        The list of abilities that can trigger this boost includes: 
                        <p>
                            <ul><li>Paladin - Holy Radiance,</li> <li>Defender - Intervene,</li> <li>Earthwarden - Chain Heal,</li> <li>Vindicator - Bubble,</li> <li>and Apothecary - Remedic Chains.</li></ul>
                        </p> I hope you enjoy figuring out how these abilities interact with the Enhanced title, as some of these abilities don't interact as simply as it seems.

                <ul>
                    <li>TL;DR: Certain weapon abilities now have effects that stack additively with one another.</li>
                    <li>There's nothing in particular with this change, I just thought designing title abilities with a
                        stacking system opens up design space for buffing individual titles by increasing the amount of
                        times their weapon ability can stack, and opens up some cool interactions with enemies...</li>
